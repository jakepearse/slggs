                                    ### Translators
                                    All programs are converted into byte-code before they can be executed on a CPU
                                    There are two types of translator.
                                    
                                    - Compiled programs are converted before they are run.
                                    
                                    - Interpreted programs are converted line-by-line as they are run.
                                    
                                    
                                    </section>
                                    
                                  <section data-markdown>
                                    ### Compiled programs
                                    - Run much faster
                                    - Are not cross platform
                                    - Source code is not distributed (necessarily)
                                    
                                    often a program will be built into *object code* an intermediate step between source code and executable code.
                                    
                                    Then a final pass through a *linker* on the target system produces the final executable.
                                    
                                      
                                    </section>

                                    ### Interpreted programs
                                    - Cross platform
                                    - Easier to debug & test (potentially)
                                    - User must have an interpreter
                                    - Source code must be distributed.
                                    - Slower to execute
                                    - No intermediate steps
                                      
                                    </section>

                                    ### Part 2: Data types
                                    Natural sounds are conveyed by sound waves.
                                    Our eyes are able to see, due to the scattering of photons (waves/particles).
                                    
                                    Converting these natural phenomenon into binary data is the process of *quantization*
                                    
                                    Taking continuous data and quantizing it into discrete bits.

                                    ### Sound
                                    A continuous sound wave is measured at a certain rate.
                                    
                                    Lets say 16,000 times per second we measure the amplitude of the wave.
                                    - We call this a 16Khz sample rate.
                                    
                                    How much detail we record in each is the bit rate.
                                    - Lets say we record 8-bits of data for each sample we make. 8-bits is the sample width.
                                    
                                    Simple, a given sound file will be of size: 
                                    
                                    size = sample_width &middot; sample_rate &middot; duration_in_seconds.

                                    ### Bitmap images
                                    Images follow a similar idea now we are representing a two dimensional array of pixels.
                                    
                                    For each pixel we need a sample size (how many different colours or shades can the pixel be in) in bits.
                                    
                                    We call this colour depth, 8-bit colour has 256 different colours including black and white.
                                    
                                    To obtain the image size in bits simply multiply the colour depth by the number of pixels.

                                    ### Meta-data
                                    So far we have seen how the raw sample data is encoded but in real life there is a lot more useful information that can be connected to this data.
                                    - Title
                                    - Artist
                                    - Date created
                                    
                                    Not to mention which colour should correspond to which binary value; palette data.
                                    
                                    This called meta-data, data about the data.
