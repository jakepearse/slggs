JavaScript
Learners are expected to be able to follow and write basic JavaScript code. It is hoped they will get practical
experience of JavaScript in their study of the course. They will not be expected to commit exact details of syntax
to memory. Questions in the exam will not penalise learners for minor inaccuracies in syntax. Learners will be
expected to be familiar with the JavaScript equivalents of the structures listed in the pseudocode section (with
the exception of input and output (see below). They will not be expected to use JavaScript for Object Oriented
programming or file handling. Questions will not be asked in JavaScript where something is passed to a subroutine
by value or reference is relevant.
Input
Input will be taken in by reading values from a form. NB learners will not be expected to memorise the method for
doing this as focus will be on what they do with that input once it is received.
Output
By changing the contents of an HTML element
chosenElement = document.getElementById(“example”);
chosenElement.innerHTML = “Hello World”;
5
By writing directly to the document
document.write(“Hello World”);
By using an alert box
alert(“Hello World”);
Should any other aspects of JavaScript be used they will be introduced and explained in the question.
